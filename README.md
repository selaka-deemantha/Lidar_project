3D LiDAR Scanner
Overview
Welcome to the 3D LiDAR Scanner project! This repository features a cost-effective 3D LiDAR scanner designed to provide high-resolution point clouds using a single laser module. By employing a TF Mini-S laser module and a distinctive cylindrical cam mechanism, our scanner achieves both horizontal and vertical scanning movements with just one stepper motor, generating a spiral-shaped point cloud.

Key Features
Single Laser Module: Utilizes a TF Mini-S laser module to measure distances, offering a budget-friendly alternative to traditional multi-laser LiDAR systems.
Innovative Mechanism: Features a cylindrical cam mechanism that enables horizontal and vertical movement with only one stepper motor.
Spiral Point Cloud Generation: Produces a spiral-shaped point cloud, providing a unique approach to 3D scanning.
Custom PCB Design: Includes an AVR microcontroller and an A4988 motor controller for precise stepper motor control.
Cost-Effective: Significantly cheaper than industrial LiDAR scanners, making it accessible for students, researchers, and enthusiasts.
Documentation
Complete documentation is provided to assist with assembly and customization:

SolidWorks Designs: Detailed models and assembly instructions.
PCB Schematics: Custom PCB layout and design files.
Source Code: Firmware for the AVR microcontroller, controlling the stepper motor and laser module.
Future Development
We are working on a software interface to enhance the functionality of the scanner. This upcoming feature will allow users to:

Adjust Scanning Parameters: Modify speed and resolution settings to fit specific needs.
Visualize Point Clouds: View and analyze the generated point clouds in real-time.
Usage
Assemble the Mechanical Parts: Follow the SolidWorks assembly instructions.
Connect the Electronics: Solder and mount components as per the PCB design.
Install the Firmware: Upload the provided firmware to the AVR microcontroller.
