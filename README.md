# 3D Lidar Scanner



This project presents a groundbreaking 3D LiDAR scanner designed to offer a cost-effective solution for generating high-resolution point clouds using a single laser module. Utilizing a TF Mini-S laser module, our scanner implements a distinctive cylindrical cam mechanism, which allows it to achieve both horizontal and vertical scanning movements with only one stepper motor. This innovative design produces a spiral-shaped point cloud, providing an affordable alternative to traditional industrial LiDAR systems, which are often expensive and complex. The system features a custom-designed PCB incorporating an AVR microcontroller and an A4988 motor controller, ensuring precise control over the stepper motor. Although the scanner operates at a slower speed compared to industrial counterparts, it significantly reduces costs and makes advanced 3D scanning accessible for students, researchers, and enthusiasts. Comprehensive documentation, including SolidWorks designs, PCB schematics, and source code, is provided to facilitate further development and customization. We are also planning to develop a software interface that will enable users to adjust scanning speed, resolution, and visualize the point clouds in real-time, enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the scanner.
